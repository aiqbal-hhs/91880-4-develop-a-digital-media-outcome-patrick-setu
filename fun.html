<h1>Rainbow's End</h1>
One of the best places when looking to have fun is the amusement park known as Rainbow’s End. Offering a wide variety with over twenty different rides and activities that are suitable to any and all age groups, they have a ride for everyone. Thrill seekers will find enjoyment in rides like the fearfall, stratosphere, and corkscrew coaster while those who are just looking for something less exhilarating may find rides like the log flume, dodgems, and bumper boats more enjoyable. They also have the kidz kingdom which is a designated area that is for younger children as the rides within are more toned down for their entertainment in comparison with the rest of the park. In addition to the many rides, Rainbow’s End also has food stalls in case you feel hungry, ranging from ice cream, burgers, pizzas, and more.

<h1>Skyline Rotorua</h1>
Skyline Rotorua has a range of activities that are enjoyed best with family and friends. Some of their most popular activities consist of the gondola ride which can take up to eight people when transporting from the base to the top where you can make a choice of what activity you want to do next. You could choose to race against others on the luge, ride their 400 metre long zipline through Redwood Forest while taking in the scenery, mountain bike down a track that has differing difficulties for all ability levels, or if you are looking for a more thrilling experience, their skyswing may be more appealing. With a maximum seating capacity of three people, it will lift you 50 metres above the ground and then come to a halt where a view of Lake Rotorua, the city, and further beyond can be seen. It will then be up to you to pull the release which starts the descent that can reach up to 150kph. Skyline Rotorua also has other activities such as strolling through a nature trail among 15,000 native trees and informative panels for up to an hour, playing on small diggers that are just like real excavators, and meeting a family of alpacas.
