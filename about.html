This is a website created for the purpose of advertising places both around Auckland and some surrounding areas. The places that are advertised are some places to hang out and some places to eat. This website has been made to complete two assessment standards assigned by Henderson High School and has been made entirely by Patrick Pancho Setu. All code and writing has been made by him and is not allowed to be copied.
